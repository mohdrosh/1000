            <p>it's been a 1000 days of us being together! sitting in my office rn all i really do here is think about you. today for some reason i was thinking about how much i don't actively remember things about us like the time we were sitting on the bench next to the park in iit and we were about to kiss but something happened and u laughed and i was thinking abt it and i just think about how naive i was, i didn't even realise what i had or what it was going to become or how my life was seriously going to forever change with you. i didn't know you at all we were rly just strangers and we liked each other and we were just trying to have nice dates but it genuinely changed my life it's sickening how much came out of all the little days we had where it wasn't even anything except lunch or walks.</p>
            
            <p>there's so much conversation and time we spent together that i don't remember at all i don't remember what we were laughing about last week or what we laughed about on our 7th date and maybe it's nice that way i do really feel all of it adding up into all the love i have for you i really know it's all there. like every single thing we had the last couple years added up to what i feel for you right now and i don't even remember half of it.</p>
            
            <p>trying to think abt smth soo random that happened maybe it was us shopping for a journal for u at khan market or when the guy at chilis asked us to write a review for him after the van gogh thing or when i was having a macaron and u saw ur college friend so much of my brain is just things that happened between us that i don't even remember and i wish i could go through it all again in my mind i was just so naive i had the most insane thing ever and i didn't even know and i do now and ill never let u go and never never fail to recognise what u have given me or what i have i really think ur the greatest person ever, of all time.</p>

            <p>i'm so excited to spend my life with you. and my life just seems to be getting so much better and i realise it's only bc of this rs getting better and how much it boosts my life it's so tied to my life that it'd all come crashing down without you seriously ugh i just love u s o much i love u paankhi ur my wife i want to marry u and i want my life w u so bad u make it so good for me hey i love u 1000 isn't enough ur my #1 person in life ur so beautiful and sexy god ur just so hot i love ur sexy body i want u forever only to be mine forever</p>
